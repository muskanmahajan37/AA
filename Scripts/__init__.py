The Python repository "AA" contains the scripts, data,
figures, and text for nudged Arctic Amplification (AA) and 
Upper-troposphere Tropical Warming (UTW). The model is SC-WACCM4.
We are interested in the large-scale atmospheric response to 
Arctic sea ice loss in AA simulations compared to sea-ice forcing.
See Peings, Cattiaux, and Magnusdottir, GRL (2019) for model set-up.
